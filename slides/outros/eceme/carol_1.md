# 3. Methodological Criticisms and the Neo-Neo Debate
-	3.1. Methodological Criticisms – Traditionalists vs. Behaviorists
-	3.2 Neo-Neo Debate – Neoliberalism vs. Neorealism

---

## 3.1 Methodological Criticisms – Traditionalists vs. Behaviorists
* Context: Behaviorist Revolution (1950s)
* Debate concerns the appropriate method to analyze/study International Relations (or International Politics)
* Debate occurred among realists, who had completely dominated internationalist discussions at that time – traditional realism and behavioral realism

---

## 3.1 Methodological Criticisms (cont’d) – Traditionalists 
* Traditionalists admit the use of imprecise (or not easily quantifiable) variables in their analyses
* Theories based on historical behavior (valuation of history)
* Despite being a positivist theory, traditionalist theories are complex and end up being less scientific as they may complicate analyses in concrete situations

---

## 3.1 Methodological Criticisms (cont’d) – Traditionalists
* Morgenthau allows the use of various and complex dimensions for the analysis of power, including diplomacy, legitimacy, etc.
* Morgenthau frequently employs historical arguments in his work, providing evidence that the behavior he describes for states can be verified through history

---

## 3.1 Methodological Criticisms (cont’d) – Behaviorists/Scientists
* Behaviorists/Scientists seek scientific patterns for internationalist theories
* Emphasize quantification, the selection of measurable and controllable variables, and the use of statistics and scientific methods drawn from the social sciences
* The theoretical basis is the idea that the behavior of states can be scientifically studied
- Behavior as the object of study (what is to be explained are the actions of states)
- Environment provides the causes for the actions of states, meaning that the behavior of states can be explained by causal factors
- Input (cause) and output (behavior)

---

## 3.1 Methodological Criticisms (cont’d) – Behaviorists/Scientists
* Man, the State, and War – Kenneth Waltz, 1959 (Neorealism) 
* Levels of analysis:
* Man: the individual level is far removed from international relations, as it requires understanding numerous specific factors that are not relevant to internationalist theory
* State: the national context of each state, although more related to the international scenario, cannot be used, as there is a great diversity of states with different cultures and histories, making a theory that considers all this complexity very unclear
* System: broadest level of analysis that is most appropriate for describing relations between states

---

## 3.1 Methodological Criticisms (cont’d) – Behaviorists/Scientists
* Theory of International Politics – Kenneth Waltz, 1979 (Neorealism)
* Systemic Structure: billiard table metaphor
- In a game of billiards, what matters is the relationship between the billiard balls on the table (each ball is seen as a solid and impregnable structure, what happens inside each ball is not relevant)
- In the international system, only the size of each state (in terms of power) and its position in the international scenario matter
* This simplification provides clarity to international theory and the ability to generate predictions
* Waltz’ Theory of International Politics is the most cited work in the history of international relations

---

## 3.2 Neo-Neo Debate – Neoliberalism vs. Neorealism 
* In the post-World War II years, the realist tradition gains clear supremacy among internationalists and liberal thinking remains limited, lacking relevant general descriptions of the organization of the international system
* Liberalism regains some influence in the 1970s, particularly during the period of détente, a time of easing tensions in the Cold War, which allows for a more cooperative view of the international system to gain some credibility

--- 

## 3.2 Neo-Neo Debate (cont’d) – Neoliberalism
* Power and Interdependence (Keohane & Nye, 1977)
* Joseph Nye and Robert Keohane publish the influential work "Power and Interdependence” (1977) marking the birth of the so-called neoliberalism.
* Complex interdependence - the key concept of Nye and Keohane's thinking is the idea of "complex interdependence”
* According to this concept, there is a relationship of interdependence among states that is complex, meaning it is distributed across various agendas and distinct themes
* As the world becomes more integrated, globalization advances, and international agendas become more complex and interconnected, the tendency is for states to have fewer reasons to engage in direct conflicts, as the risk of losses becomes increasingly significant

---

## 3.2 Neo-Neo Debate (cont’d) – Neorealism 
* 1979 – Iranian Revolution, Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, start of the Second Cold War.
* Keohane and Nye's work loses credibility in a context of renewed Cold War tensions
* Waltz publishes his famous book: "Theory of International Politics"

---

## 3.2 Neo-Neo Debate (cont’d) – Neoliberalism 
* 1984 – "After Hegemony” (Keohane)
* In 1984, a few years after absorbing neorealistic thinking (particularly Waltz's work), Keohane publishes “After Hegemony” aimed at rethinking aspects of neoliberal thinking in light of realist arguments
* Neoliberalism concessions to neorealism:
- States are the main actors
- Actors act selfishly
- The international system is fundamentally marked by anarchy
* Neoliberalism reservations regarding neorealism
	- States tend to cooperate
- States seek absolute gains
- International Organizations are important (spaces for exchanges and building credibility)
- Game theory: games in the international sphere are repeated, and the interaction is continuous (criticism to neorealist thinkers who typically made isolated, non-repeated game analyses)

---

## 3.2 Neo-Neo Debate (cont’d) – Neo-Neo Synthesis
* After Keohane's work, which largely adopts the same premises as neorealists but arrives at slightly different conclusions, a movement of forming a consensus in the academic field of international relations begins
* The debate between neorealists and neoliberals brings the two currents very close together, making them very similar, differing only on a few points of contention (relative gains vs. absolute gains; greater or lesser importance of International Organizations, etc.).

---

# 4. New Paradigms:
* 4.1. Marxism 
* 4.2. Critical Theory
* 4.3 Constructivism

---

## 4.1 New Paradigms: Marxism 
* The first significant rupture in the Neo-Neo Debate occurred with the publication of a Marxist theory of international relations
* “Production, Power, and World Order" by Robert Cox, published in 1987.
* In the past, Marxism had dealt with international political issues specifically on certain regional contexts and did not aim to describe the international order in broader terms (globalism, criticism of the international division of labor, dependency theory)
* Main ruptures:
- Critique of state centrism
- Introduction of social classes as a relevant category

---

## 4.1 New Paradigms (cont’d): Marxism 
* Arguments:
* National bourgeoisies play a key role in shaping the international order.
* National bourgeoisies have essentially national interests (they have economic interests founded on creating national barriers that allow for the organization of production within the state and the systematization of trade relations through state instances)
* The bourgeoisies condition national policies, create conflicts to reinforce national territorial divisions, and use the working classes in their power struggles
* The very existence and survival of the state are based on interests articulated by these national bourgeoisies.
* The working classes, however, do not necessarily have nationalist interests

---

## 4.2 New Paradigms (cont’d): Critical Theory
* Robert Cox's work is also significantly influenced by the Frankfurt School, known as the Critical School.
* The theory of international relations is not neutral (authors who produce theories of international relations work in institutions financed and maintained with resources from the international bourgeoisie and the state and, therefore, are committed to valorizing the role of the state in international relations, as well as perpetuating ideas that serve the interests of these bourgeoisie and states)
* Example: "Washington Consensus"

---

## 4.2 New Paradigms (cont’d): Constructivism
* With the influence of Cox's Marxist theory, there is a broader movement of questioning the foundations of internationalist theories produced up to that point.
* “Epistemological opening”: movement focused on a progressive opening of international relations to new forms of argumentation and new variables and analytical conditions
* Methodological transformation (shift from behaviorist positivism to post-positivism – post-colonialism, post-modernism, feminism).

---

## 4.2 New Paradigms (cont’d): Constructivism
* The constructivist theory gained prominence through the works of two main authors: Nicholas Onuf and Alexander Wendt.
* Key Works:
* In 1989, Nicholas Onuf published "World of Our Making," and a few years later, in 1992, Alexander Wendt published the article "Anarchy is What States Make of It"
* In 1999, Alexander Wendt would publish his main work (“Social Theory of International Relations”), with an implicit reference to Waltz's work

---

## 4.2 New Paradigms (cont’d): Constructivism
* The main conceptual basis of constructivism is the idea that agent and structure cannot be separated (absence of "ontological primacy" between agent and structure)
* Classical liberalism and realism: agents precede structure
* Neoliberalism and neorealism: structure precedes the agent
* Constructivism: co-constitution of agent and structure
* Main constructivism ideas:
	* Reality is socially constructed
* Anarchy is what States make of it (it will depend on how states deal with international anarchy)
* Hobbesian anarchy: conflictual anarchy
* Lockean anarchy: contractual anarchy
* Kantian anarchy: cooperative anarchy

---

## 4.2 New Paradigms (cont’d): Constructivism (Onuf vs. Wendt)
* Onuf is a postmodern constructivist who advocates a role for the international theorist in deconstructing the artificially constructed and naturalized reality as something fixed and immutable.
* Wendt is more conservative and advocates the need to maintain and protect this socially constructed reality
*Constructivism is an autonomous theoretical current, but it is a current so flexible that we can consider it as a meta-theory (one can be a constructivist with a realist or a liberalism bias, as long as they conclude that this socially constructed reality closely resembles the description made by realists or liberals)

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions
* In the immediate post-Cold War era, there was no possibility of the Soviet Union or any other state posing a convincing military threat to the United States
* As a result, the liberal discourse took on a triumphant character, and the concepts of liberal democracy and capitalism solidified as symbols of human progress

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* The memorable speech by then-President of the United States, George H. W. Bush, on September 11, 1990, addressed a "new world order”
* The speech was delivered shortly after the start of the Gulf War (intervention that had the authorization and support of the United Nations)
* The conflict was based on liberal principles, seeking the liberation of Kuwait, which was "occupied and oppressed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq” (it was believed that the United Nations' strength would maintain international security under a liberal peace)
---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* Another example of the liberal triumphalist sentiment was the prominence given to the economist Francis Fukuyama, who published the work "The End of History and the Last Man" in 1992
* Once the liberal state emerged victorious from this confrontation, the "end of history" would occur, and humanity would no longer experience conflicts or wars.
*The end of the Cold War represented an ideological victory of liberalism as the most sophisticated form of organizing society and the world (in opposition to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, who predicted the full realization of socialism as the culmination of human progress)

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* The perspective regarding the end of conflicts due to the acclaim of liberalism traces back to the work of Emmanuel Kant
* "Perpetual Peace” (1795)
* Governments based on liberal logic, organized according to a representative republic, would not go to war
* Citizens to whom the head of a representative government must answer would not be willing to bear the costs of war.
* The theoretical foundation of Kant's idea of perpetual peace, based on liberalism, gained contemporary contours through the studies of Dean Babst
	* Elective Governments: A Force For Peace" (1964)
* Triumph of the liberal democratic model as a form of government organization would represent the end of conflicts between states

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* The international post-Cold War scenario was very different from what was expected of the "new world order"
* New wars – Conflicts between states had effectively almost ended, it was not possible to achieve a scenario of world peace due to the persistence of violent conflicts, which Mary Kaldor referred to as "new wars".
* “During the 1980s and 1990s, a new type of organized violence has developed, especially in Africa and Eastern Europe, which is one aspect of the current globalized era. I describe this type of violence as ‘new wars’”. (KALDOR, 1999)

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* Additional international regimes were inadequate to successfully maintain international peace according to liberal principles
* Complications faced by the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Rwanda demonstrated this incapacity

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* The response found to deal with these new threats was development
* Underdevelopment came to be seen as a security issue, and international security was conceived as a result of the development of different states
* Poverty, political instability, economic disparities, and lack of access to basic resources in underdeveloped areas were acknowledged as factors that could lead to internal conflicts

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* UNDP – The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) introduced the concept of human security in 1994.
* "The concept of security has for too long been interpreted narrowly: as security of territory from external aggression, or as protection of national interests in foreign policy or as global security from the threat of a nuclear holocaust. It has been related more to nation-states than to people. (…) The idea of human security, though simple, is likely to revolutionize society in the 21st century. (…) Human security can be said to have two main aspects. It means, first, safety from such chronic threats as hunger, disease and repression. And second, it means protection from sudden and hurtful disruptions in the patterns of daily life, whether in homes, in jobs or in communities. Such threats can exist at all levels of national income and development" (UNDP, 1994, p. 22-23)

---

##5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* R2P – The concept of human security was a steppingstone for the establishment of the notion of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) within the United Nations.
* R2P was accepted as a UN principle in 2005
* R2P delegates to the international community the responsibility to protect people around the world from violations of their rights and dignity through humanitarian interventions when a sovereign state is unable or unwilling to ensure the human security of its nationals

---

##5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
*After the unsuccessful humanitarian intervention in Libya in 2011, interventions under R2P have been increasingly viewed with suspicion
* The use of military measures to address issues arising from the broadening of the security concept is referred to as "securitization."
* The Copenhagen School has drawn attention to the increasing reliance on this strategy
* Barry Buzan defines securitization as a way to justify the non-application of certain rules or procedures
* “The way to study securitization is to study discourse and political constellations: When does an argument with this particular rhetorical and semiotic structure achieve sufficient effect to make an audience tolerate violations of rules that would otherwise have to be obeyed? If by means of an argument about the priority and urgency of an existential threat the securitizing actor has managed to break free of procedures or rules he or she would otherwise be bound by, we are witnessing a case of securitization." (BUZAN, 1998).

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* Mark Duffield (2010) interprets the promotion of development with the objective of consolidating international security as a form of an "unwinnable global civil war."
* Although the number of actual civil wars in states has reduced, there is currently a situation of indistinction between war and peace in various states

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
* International relations/politics have become more complex and multifaceted with the emergence of new themes such as:
* Environmental challenges: climate change, biodiversity, natural resource management, sustainable development
* Gender: gender equality, women's rights, women, peace, and security
* Cybersecurity and digital governance: cyberwarfare, data privacy, internet governance, artificial intelligence
* Global health: access to healthcare and vaccines, pandemic preparedness
Access to Healthcare
* Migration and refugees: forced displacement, migration policies, refugee protection
* Global governance and international institutions: reforming the United Nations, regional integration, role of non-state actors

---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
Discussion 1:
* World Trade Organization (WTO) established in 1995 to facilitate global trade and promote economic cooperation
* WTO Appellate Body Crisis (2019): the Appellate Body requires a minimum of three judges to function, but due to the United States' blocking of new appointments, it currently has only one judge
* The absence of a functioning Appellate Body hinders the dispute settlement process and delays resolution of trade disputes (WTO members resort to arbitration and unilateral actions, potentially leading to increased trade tensions and instability)


---

## 5 Contemporary problems and questions (cont’d)
Discussion 2:
* Conflict between Russia and Ukraine began in 2014, parked by Russia's annexation of Crimea, leading to tensions in Eastern Ukraine
* Escalated into Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022)
* Humanitarian impacts (thousands killed, displacement of civilians, human rights violations and war crimes alleged against both sides)
* International response:
	* Economic sanctions against Russia by the EU, US and other countries
* Diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful resolution
